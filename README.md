This is a repository with 3 docker tasks that I solved in order to learn Docker.<br>
Task1: Use a Ubuntu image and execute some Linux commands.<br>
Task2: Create a Dockerfile and dockerize an application. I also learned how to use GitHub Actions.<br>
Task3: Use a MySQL image and learn how to connect to a database and manipulate the data. <br>
I created a volume in order to persistently store the database files and ensure that data remains available even if the container is stopped or deleted. 
This allows for data persistence and facilitates easy management and backup of the database.
